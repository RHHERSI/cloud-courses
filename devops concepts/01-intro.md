# Introduction by Nick Triantafillou

High level overview of the Software Development Lyfecyle (SDLC)

Many definitions and number of steps.

## SDLC Steps

### Planning

Discover the aims and issues of the client

### Analysis

Deep dive into requirements.

### Design

Solutions are designed and presented to the client

### Implementation

Working code is produced, results are shown to the client

### Testing

Quality assurance engineers search for bugs, testing of all features is required.

### Deployment

Tested product is ready to be released to production and basded on feedback, the cycle will start again.

## What is DevOps ?

Software Development

Software Operations

### Development

* Identifying needs
* Planning and designing solutions
* Programming, testing and documenting
* Deploying and maintaining

### Operations

* Help desk
* Infrastructure management
* Configuration management
* Disaster mitigation (against attacks, memory management, etc...)

Since both teams used to be separated, it always resulted in unhappy customers.

The closer integration between the two areas made everyone happier.

**REF Patrick Debois - Father of DevOps**

### Benefits

* Speed (release updates and changes)
* Reliability (no buggy releases)
* Scale (horizontally)
* Collaboration (workflows for best efficiency)
* Security (infrastructure as code, policies, etc...)

## CALMS Framework

**Disclaimer: DevOps is not just a process, it is more of a culture shift**

### Culture

DevOps must have the backing of business executives.

* DevOps makes developers responsible (unit testing)
* No dedicated response teams (team ownership)
* Strive to implement devops across all departments
* Channels of communication need to be open, and people need to be able to talk freely and regularly.

### Automation

* Eliminates repetitive work
* Reduces mistakes
* Creates reiliable and efficient systems
* Automate what used to take a long time
* Automated testing finds what you may have overlooked
* Automation saves time and money

### Lean

Agile minset

* Eliminate low-value activities and move quickly
* Use of lean principles to eliminate waste
* Reduce handoff complexity
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Deliver quickly and quality

### Measurement

Prove your efforts are working.

* Strive to capture sophisticated metrics and basic metrics
* Helps your team to make decisions
* Helps other teams to make decisions
* Be transparent, and adapt to what the metrics are telling

### Sharing

Sharing keeps everyone working toward the same goal.

* Sharing eases friction between teams
* Learn from other member's experiences
* Growth comes from success and failure
