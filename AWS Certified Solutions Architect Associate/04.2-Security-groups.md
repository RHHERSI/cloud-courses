# AWS Security Groups by Ryan Kroonenburg

**Security Group rule update takes effect immediatelyb**

## Inbound Rules

Opened doors for external access

* HTTP opened on 80 for any IP `0.0.0.0/0`

## Outbound Rules

Traffic to external

**Allowing Inbound, Security Group allows Outbound the same rule**

**Security Groups are WhiteListing Only**

**Everything is blocked by default until configured to allowed**

*It is possible to assign more than one security group to the EC2 instance*

### Exam Tips

*All inbound traffic is blocked by **DEFAULT***

*All Outbound traffic is allowed*

*Changes take effect immediately*

*Any number of EC2 instances within a Security Group*

*Multiple security groups attached to EC2 Instances*

*Security groups are **STATEFUL** meaning creating an Inbound rule will also create an Outbound rule exactly alike*

*Cannot block IPs or Ports -> **NO DENY RULES***
