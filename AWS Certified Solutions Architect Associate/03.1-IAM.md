        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"

### Lesson Outputs

* **IAM is UNIVERSAL**
* The **ROOT** account is simply the account created when first setup AWS account
    * ROOT has **full access** and therefore must be protected. *Setup MFA*
* New Users have **NO PERMISSIONS** when first created
* New Users are assigned ACCESS KEY ID & SECRET ACCESS KEY when created
* Key and Secret are **NOT** the same as password.
    * Key and Secret are used for **programmatic** access (SDK, CLI)
    * Password is used for **console** login 
* Create and Customise **password rotation policies** (expiration, lower case, upper case...)
