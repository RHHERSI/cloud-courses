# AWS Storage Gateway by Ryan Kroonenburg

## What is Storage Gateway ?

Service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely store data to the AWS cloud for scalable and cost effective storage.

* Data Center
* Virtual (VM) or Physical Device (Storage Gateway)
  * Connects to

Virtual Machine Hyper-V or VMWare ESXi

### File Gateway (NFS & SMB)

A way of storing files in S3

Files are stored as objects in S3 Buckets. Accesses through a Network File System.

It becomes an S3 object native (all resources)

`App Server -> Storage Gateway -> Internet -> Amazon S3`

**Flat files directly in S3**

### Volume Gateway (iSCSI)

* Stored Volumes (HDs or Virtual HDs)
  * Store primary data locally, while asynchronously backing up data to AWS
  * Low-latency access to their entire dataset
  * 1 GB up to 16 TB
  * `App Server -> iSCI Protocol -> Virtual Machine with Storage Gateway -> Store Snapshots on S3` 
  * **Entire Dataset stored on site and async backup to s3**
  
* Cached Volumes (HDs or Virtual HDs)
  * Low-latency access to their frequently accessed data.
  * Up to 32 TB
  * Retains recent read data on on-premise cache
  * `App Server -> iSCI Protocol -> Virtual Machine with Storage Gateway -> Store Snapshots on S3` 
  * **Entire Dataset stored in s3 and frequently accessed data is cached on site**
Data written can be asynchronously backed up as point-in-time snapshots as Amazon EBS Snapshots

### Tape Gateway (VTL)

Archive data in AWS.
Tape-based backup
Each tape gateway is preconfigured with a media changer and tape drives.
Supported by NetBackup and some others...

* `Backup Application -> Virtual Machine -> Virtual Tape on S3`

* **Backup Tape based**
