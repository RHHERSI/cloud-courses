# AWS EC2 Summary by Ryan Kroonenburg

EC2 is a web service that provides compute capacity.

## Pricing Models

* On Demand -> Fixed rate by hour or second (no fixed term)
* Reserved -> 1 or 3 year term (may pay upfront for discount)
* Spot -> bid on instance price
  * If terminated by price changes, no charges apply for partial hour of usage
  * If terminated yourself, charges are applied
* Dedicated Hosts -> Physical EC2 (good for licensing)

## Instance Types

* F - FPGA
* I - IOPS
* G - GRAPHICS
* H - HIGH DISK THROUGHPUT
* T - GENERAL PURPOSE
* D - DENSITY
* R - RAM
* M - MAIN CHOICE FOR GENERAL PURPOSE
* C - COMPUTE
* P - GRAPHICS (PICS)
* X - EXTREME MEMORY
* Z - EXTREME MEMORY AND CPU
* A - ARM-BASED
* U - BARE METAL

## EBS

Block Storage.

Termination Protection is off by default

* Root EBS volume is deleted when EC2 instance is deleted
* Aditional volumes are not deleted automatically
* EBS Root Volumes can be encrypted
* Possible to alter volume sizes on the fly
* ALWAYS in the same AZ as the EC2 instance

### Types

SSDs
* General Purpose
* Provisioned IOPS
HDDs
* Throughput Optimized
* Cold HDD
* EBS Magnetic

### Snapshots

* Exist in S3
* Are incremental
* Point in time copies of Volumes
* Recommended to stop the instance before taking snapshot (but may be done in running)
* Unencrypted snapshots can be encrypted

### Migrating

* Take snapshot, use AMI to launch EC2 in another AZ.

* Copy AMI to another region

## Security Groups

* All inbound traffic is blocked by default
* All Outbound traffic is allowed
* Changes take effect immediately
* Any number of instances within a security group
* Multiple security groups can be attached to an instance
* Security Groups are **Stateful** -> Inbound and Outbound traffic are configured together
* Only Allow rules, **no DENY**

## Instance Store

* Volumes cannot be stopped. If stopped, data is lost
* Can't be kept after EC2 Instance Termination

## Enhanced Networking

ENI
* Virtual network
* Good for separate networking

ENA
* Speeds between 10 and 100 Gbps

EFA
* HPC
* OS by-pass

## CloudWatch

* Monitoring performance
* On EC2 -> 5 min or 1 min interval
* CloudWatch alarms for notifications
* Dashboards with metrics
* Logging

## CloudTrail

* Auditing API Calls and resource changes
* Blame on who called the API

## CLI

Interact with AWS through CLI

* IAM Access Key and Secret

## Roles

* Set role to EC2 to avoid `aws configure`
* Easier to manage
* Roles are universal

## Bootstrap Scripts

* Run when EC2 instance first boots
* Powerful automating software installs and updates

## Instance meta-data and user-data

`169.254.169.254`

user-data: Bootstrap script
meta-data: data about the instance

## EFS

* Supports the NFS protocol
* Pay for the storage used (no pre-provisioning)
* Scale up
* Support multiple concurrent connections
* Data stored in multiple AZs
* Read after Write consistency

## FSx for Windows

* SMB
* Windows-based applications

## FSx for Lustre

* HPC applications

## Placement Groups

Cluster
* Everything on the same AZ
* Low latency / high network throughput
Spread
* Individual critical EC2 instances
* Different hardware / AZ
Partitioned
* Group multiple EC2 instances and separate groups in different racks
* Cassandra

## WAF

* Block malicious IP
* SQL Injection
* XSS
* Countries
* Query String parameters
