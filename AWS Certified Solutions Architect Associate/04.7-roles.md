# AWS IAM Roles by Ryan Kroonenburg

## Roles

Create Role
* Pick EC2 Service
* Pick policy (AdminAccess)
* Name Role (role-ec2-admin)

Instead of running `aws configure` on EC2 instance, **attach role**

With full admin access role, any aws command can be run without credentials

* *Roles are more secure than storing access and secret keys on individual EC2 instances*
* *Roles are easier to manage*
* *Roles can be assigned to EC2 instances after creation from console & cli*
* *Roles are UNIVERSAL*
