# AWS ENI vs ENA vs EFA by Ryan Kroonenburg

## ENI - Elastic Network Interface

Essentially a virtual network card

* A primary IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of VPC
* One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the range
* One elastic IP address per private IPv4 address
* One public IPv4
* One or mode IPv6
* One or more Security Groups
* One MAC address
* A source/destination check flag

### Use Cases

* Management Network
* Use network and security appliances on VPC
* Create dual-homed instances with workloads/roles on distinct subnets
* Low-budget high available solutions

## EN - Enhanced Networking

Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide **HIGH PERFORMANCE** networking capabilities on supported instance types.

Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional chages (EC2 instance has to allow)

### Use cases

Where you want good network performance

### ENA - Elastic Network Adapter

Speeds up to 100Gbps

### Virtual Function (Intel 82599 VF)

Speeds up to 10 Gbps

*Overlooked*

## EFA - Elastic Fabric Adapter

A network device that can be attached to EC2 instance to accelerate **High Performance Computing (HPC)** and machine learning applications

* Lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than the TCP Transport
* Can use OS-bypass -> Communicate directly with the EFA device

### Exam tips

Given a scenario, choose between ENI, ENA or EFA

ENI: 
* *Basic Networking*
* *Separate Management network to production network*
* *Low Cost*

ENA:
* *Speeds between 10 to 100 Gbps*
* *Reliable and High throughput*

EFA:
* *HPC and Machine Learning*
* *OS by-pass*
