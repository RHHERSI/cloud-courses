# AWS EFS by Ryan Kroonenburg

## Elastic File System

File storage service for EC2 instances

EC2 instances can share EFS volumes

Storage capacity is elastic

## Lab

Access EFS

* Create File System
* Pick VPC
* Pick Name

Launch EC2 Instance

```sh
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
```

*Utilizes NFS protocol, **MUST update Security Group Inbound Rules for NFS***

inside the EC2 instance:

```sh
sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-123:/ /var/www/html
```

From now on, any EC2 instance with this command will receive data from EFS

## Exam Tips

* *Supports NFSv4 protocol*
* *No pre-provisiong, pay for usage*
* *Can scale up to Petabytes*
* *Supports thousands of concurrent NFS connections*
* *Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region*
* *Read after write consistency*
