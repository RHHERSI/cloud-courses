# AWS EC2 Summary by Ryan Kroonenburg

## EC2 101 Elastic Compute Cloud

Web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Amazon EC2 **reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances** to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

*Provision Virtual Machines in MINUTES*

### Pricing Models

#### On Demand

Allows to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.

Useful for:
* Users that want low cost and flexibility without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
* Applications with short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads
* Applications being developed or tested for the first time

#### Reserved

Provides capacity reservation, and offer a **SIGNIFICANT** discount on the hourly charge for an instance.

Contract Terms are 1 Year or 3 Year Terms.

Useful for:
* Application with steady state or predictable usage
* Applications that require reserved capacity
* Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

##### Pricing

* Standard -> 75% off on demand instances
* Convertible Reserved Instances -> 54% off on demand capability
* Schedules Reserved Instances -> Available to launch within the time windows

#### Spot

Enables to bid whatever price wanted for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times

Useful for:
* Apps that have flexible start and end times
* Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
* Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

#### Dedicated Hosts

Physical EC2 server dedicated for own use.

Can help reduce costs by allowing to use with existing server-bound software licenses.

Useful for:
* Regulatory requirements (dedicated host)
* Licensing (i.e. oracle licensing)
* Can be purchased on-demand (hourly)

### Instance Types

Many types of instances specific to some use cases

<img src='./assets/ec2types.png'>


* F -> FPGA
* I -> IOPS
* G -> Graphics
* H -> High Disk Throughput
* T -> Cheap General Purpose
* D -> Density
* R -> RAM
* M -> Main choice for General Purpose apps
* C -> Compute
* P -> Graphics (pics)
* X -> Extreme Memory
* Z -> Extreme Memory and CPU
* A -> Arm-based Workloads
* U -> Bare Metal

### Test Outputs

*EC2 is virtual machines in the cloud*

*Reduces the time required to boot and obtain new instances to minutes*

*Quickly scale capacity up and down*

*Remember Pricing Types*

*If a SPOT instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage, but if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran*

## EC2 Demo

Access EC2
* Launch Instance
* Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
* Choose an Instance Type (t2.micro free-eligible)
* Configure Instance Details
  * Number of instances (1)
  * Purchasing option (on-demand)
  * Network (Default VPC) 
  * Subnet (Default)
  * Auto-assign Public IP (Default)
  * Shutdown behavior (Stop)
  * Enable termination protection (Yes)
  * Monitoring (CloudWatch)
* Add Storage
  * Volume Type (SSD, HDD or Magnetic) 
* Add Tags
* Configure Security Group (Virtual Firewall -> Allows particular Ports)
  * SSH on 22
  * HTTP on 80
* Review Instance Launch
* Key pair generation (FIRST TIME)

SSH In with key pair

yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
nano index.html
```html
<div>Hello</div>
```
service httpd start
chkconfig on

`ec2-3-85-47-76.compute-1.amazonaws.com on browser`

*It is now possible to encrypt root volume*

### Exam TIps

* *Termination Protection is default OFF*
* *On EBS-backed instance, the DEFAULT ACTION IS FOR THE ROOT EBS volume to be DELETED*
* *EBS Root Volumes can now be encrypted*
* *Other volumes are not default deleted*
