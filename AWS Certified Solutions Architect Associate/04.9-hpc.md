# AWS HPC by Ryan Kroonenburg

High-performance computing

## Data Transfer

How to get data to aws

* Snowball, Snowmobile
* AWS Data Sync (to store on s3, efs, fsx, etc...)
* Direct Connect
  * Dedicated network connection from on-premise to AWS

## Compute & Networking

* EC2 Instance (GPU or CPU optmized)
* EC2 Fleets (Spot instances / fleets)
* Placement groups (cluster)
* Enhanced Networking (ENA / EFA)
  * SR-IOV to provide high performance networking

## Storage

* Instance-attached Storage
  * EBS (up to 64000 IOPS)
  * Instance Store (millions of IOPS)
* Network Storage
  * S3
  * EFS
  * FSx (Windows or Lustre)

## Orchestration & Automation

* AWS Batch (Run hundreds of thousands batch computing jobs)
  * Spans multiple EC2 instances
* ParallelCluster
  * Manage HPC Clusters
  * Text file to model and provision resources as neded
  * Automate creation of vpc, subnets, cluster types and instance types

*Achieve HPC through Data Transfer, Compute & Networking, Storage and Orchestration & Automation*
