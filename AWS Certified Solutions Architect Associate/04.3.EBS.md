# AWS EBS by Ryan Kroonenburg

## EBS 101

Amazon Elastic Block Store

Provides persistent block storage volumes for use with **Amazon EC2** instances.

Each EBS volume is automatically replicated within its AZs to protect from component failure.

*Offers High Availability and Durability*

*Virtual HD in the Cloud*

### Types

* General Purpose (SSD)
  * Balanced Price and Performance (WorkLoads)
  * API Name: GP2
  * Max IOPS/Volume: 16000 
* Provisioned IOPS (SSD) -> Really fast IOs
  * Mission-Critical applications (Databases)
  * API Name: io1
  * Max IOPS/Volume: 64000 
* Throughput Optimised Hard Disk Drive (Magnetic)
  * Low cost HDD Volume (Big Data & Data Warehouses)
  * API Name: st1
  * Max IOPS/Volume: 500  
* Cold Hard Disk Drive (Magnetic)
  * Lowest cost HDD Volume, Less frequently accessed workloads (File Servers)
  * API Name: sc1
  * Max IOPS/Volume: 200  
* Magnetic
  * Previous generation HDD (Workloads of Infrequently accessed data)
  * API Name: Standard
  *  Max IOPS/Volume: 400-200

## EBS Volumes & Snapshots

*EC2 instance and volume are always in the same AZ*

**Root Volume is Delete on Termination**

* Create EC2 Instance
* Configure EBS (pick a couple of different types)

It is possible to **modify the size** after creation
* Modified from 500GB to 600GB

It is possible to modify the **Volume Type** after creation
* Modified from gp2 to io1

### Moving Volumes to different AZs

* Create Snapshot

*Takes a while*

* Create Image from Snapshot
  * Virtualization Type (**Hardware-assisted Virtualization** or Paravirtual)

*The image is stored under AMIs*

* Launch image on t2.micro
* Pick **Subnet** (By doing so, picking a certain **AZ**)
* Launch Instance

*AMI Images can be copied to different regions*

### Volume Persistency

When terminating an instance, any volume configured to **NOT DELETING ON TERMINATE**, will persist.

After Termination: Volumes change state to *Available*

### Exam Tips

* *Volumes exist on EBS, it is a virtual Hard Disk*
* *Snapshots exist on S3. Disk Photographs*
* *Snapshots are point in time copies of volumes*
* *Snapshots are incremental - only the blocks that have changed since last snapshot are moved to s3*
* *First Snapshot may take some time*
* *When creating a snapshot of EBS root volumes, it is recommended to stop the instance before*
* *Create AMIs from Snapshots*
* *Change EBS Volumes on the fly (Size and Type)*
* *Volumes will always be in the same AZ as the EC2 instance*
* *To move EC2 volume to another AZ. `Snapshot -> AMI from Snapshot -> Use AMI to launch EC2 instance in the new AZ`*
 
## AMI Types (EBS vs Instance Store)

Select AMI Based on:
* Region
* OS
* Architecture (32 or 64 bit)
* Launch Permission
* Storage for the Root Device
  * Instance Store
  * EBS Backed Volumes 

All AMIs are categorized as either backed by EBS or Instance Store.

**For EBS Volumes:**
* Root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an EBS Volume created from EBS Snapshot

**For Instance Store Volumes:**
* Root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a **TEMPLATE STORED IN S3**

### Instance Store

* Not all Instance Types are available
* Aditional Instance Store Volumes can only be added during creation of instance
* *However, it is possible to add EBS Volumes on the fly*
* Instance Store volume does not show up on **Volumes TAB**
* *Can Only Reboot or Terminate instance, no way to **STOP***

## Exam Tips

* *Instance Store are also called EPHEMERAL STORAGE -> If it stops, all data is lost*
* *It can't be stopped, only rebooted or terminated*
* *EBS backed instances can be stopped*
* By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination.
* EBS ROOT Volumes can be kept after termination whereas Instance Store can't
