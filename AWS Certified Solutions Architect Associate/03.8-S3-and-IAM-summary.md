# AWS S3 & IAM Summary by Ryan Kroonenburg

## IAM

* Users
  * **No Permissions** when first created 
  * Access Key ID and Secret Access Keys (for programmatic access) *Can only see once, or regenerate*
  * Password (for console)
* Groups
  * Collections for users 
* Roles
* Policies
  * Apply policies to Users
  * Apply policies to Groups (Users inherit)
  * Apply policies to Roles (Other AWS Service permissions)
  * JSON

* IAM is **UNIVERSAL**
* ROOT account is the first account (Complete ADM access)
  *  Always need MFA for security
*  Create and Customise password rotation policies for new users

## S3

* Object Based
* Files can be 0 Bytes to 5 TB
* Unlimited Storage
* Files are stored in Buckets 
* **S3 is a universal namespace**, buckets need **unique names**
* **Not SUITABLE TO INSTALL OPERATING SYSTEM**
* Successful uploads responde HTTP Status Code **200**
* By default new buckets are **PRIVATE**
  * Bucket policies (Bucket level restrictions)
  * Access Control Lists (Object level restrictions) 
* Can configure S3 access logs (*Store in S3 same account or different*)
  
### Key fundamentals

* Key (Name of the object)
* Value (byte sequence for file)
* Version ID (Versioning)
* Metadata (Data about data, tags)
* Subresources
  * ACL
  * Torrents
* Read After Write Consistency for **PUTS of new objects**
* Eventual Consistency in **UPDATES and DELETES**

### Tiering

* S3 Standard
  * 99.99%  Availability
  * 99.999999999% Durability
  * Redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities
* S3 - IA
  * Retrieval fee
* S3 - One Zone IA
  * Only one AZ 
* S3 - Intelligent Tiering
  * Move between Standard and IA based on usage
* S3 Glacier
  * Archive with configurable retrieval times from minutes to hours
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  * Archive with 12 hours retrieval

*Avoid Standard, use intelligent if needed to make sure to take advantage of IA*

*Crucial data can't be stored in One Zone - IA*

### Encryption

In Transit:
* HTTPS

At Rest:
* SSE-S3
  * S3 managed key 
* SSE-KMS
  * KMS managed key 
* SSE-C
  * Customer provided key
* Client Side encryption 

### Organizations for Shared S3

* Paying Account should only be used for billing purposes
* Enable/Disable AWS Services using SCP either on OU or Individual accounts

3 ways to share buckets
* Bucket policies and IAM (SDK)
* Access Control Lists and IAM (SDK)
* Cross-account IAM Roles (SDK + Console)
  * From one AWS account, assume a role from another

### Cross Region Replication

* Versioning must be enabled in both buckets
* Files in existing bucket are not replicated automatically
* New updates/puts are replicated
* Deletes are not replicated

### Lifecycle Policies

* Automates moving objects between storage tiers
* With versioning -> Apply rules to previous and current version

### Transfer Acceleration

* Edge Locations with CloudFront
* Backbone network to upload to s3

## CloudFront

* Edge Location -> Where content will be cached
* Origin -> Source of files (s3, EC2, Elastic load balancer, route53)
* Distribution -> Name of CDN, collection of Edge Locations
* Web Distribution -> Websites
* RTMP -> Media Streaming

* Edge Locations are not read only, writes are allowed
* Cache is defined by TTL (or policies)
* Cache can be invalidated but it is chargeable

## Snowball

* Big Disk to move data in and out of AWS
* Import/Export to S3

## Storage Gateway

### File Gateway

Files to S3 directly

### Volume Gateway

#### Stored Volume

* Entire Dataset stored on site and async backup to S3

#### Cached Volume

* Entire Dataset stored in S3, only most frequently accessed data are stored locally.

### Virtual Tape Library

* Backup for popular backup applications on tapes

## Athena

* Interactive query service
* Query data in S3 with SQL
* Serverless
* Analyse logs stored in S3

## Macie

* AI to analyze data in S3 and helps identify PII
* Analyse CloudTrail logs for suspicious api activity
* Dashboards, reports and alerting
* Prevent ID Theft
